Safety
---
Please be sure to follow standard saafety precautions when working with anything electrical. 

Most printers run on a 24V power supply so you will need to provide your own step down converter.  
*i.e. If you use Octoprint and have a Raspberry Pi on your printer you can power the LED and the Pi from the same step down converter.*

Be sure you understand how to properly calculate current and wattage, ensure that the resistor you use can handle the load provided.
